# Transactions-Viewer

A full-stack project to work with simple transaction data.

## Project Structure

There are two main components, the client code (found in the `/client` folder) and the server code
(found in the `/server` folder).

## Local Setup

Ensure you have a modern version of node. This was developed with Node 22.

1. clone this repository
2. npm install
3. npm run dev (runs both client and server in development mode, each can be run separately as well)

Additional information can be found in the readme files in both the client and server folders.

## Tasks

1. Get full-stack app running and loaded in your browser.
2. Add a new API endpoint in [server/src/index.ts](./server/src/index.ts) to serve data for a
   specific transaction.
3. Implement the UI for this new endpoint in [client/src/Modal.tsx](./client/src/Modal.tsx)

## Bonus Tasks

Anything you can do to highlight your skill set is welcome. Some suggestions:

- Improve styling of the app
- Create TypeScript interfaces or otherwise improve the type safety of the app
- Add new tests on the frontend or backend or improve existing tests
- Handle any of the various todos found in code comments
